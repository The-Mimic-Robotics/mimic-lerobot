1. created the Mecanum base class
src/lerobot/motors/mecanum_base/mecanum.py
2. Test file for the class
python test_base.py
3. create the follower
-> based on src/lerobot/robots/bi_so100_follower

src/lerobot/robots/mimic_follower
important -> using the encoders to get the observation
need to verify the encoder accurancy to make suere viable
pi0 using encoders as secondary inputs
