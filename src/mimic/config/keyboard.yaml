# Keyboard Control Configuration
# Configuration for keyboard-based base control
# Similar to ROS joy_node teleop_twist_keyboard

# Control Mode
mode: keyboard

# Speed Settings (m/s and rad/s)
speeds:
  max_linear_speed: 0.1   # Maximum forward/backward and strafe speed (m/s)
  max_angular_speed: 0.2  # Maximum rotation speed (rad/s)
  
  # Optional: Different speeds for different directions
  # max_forward_speed: 0.15
  # max_backward_speed: 0.1
  # max_strafe_speed: 0.1

# Key Mappings (cannot be changed with pynput, but documented here)
key_bindings:
  # Movement
  forward: w           # Move forward (+X)
  backward: s          # Move backward (-X)
  strafe_left: a       # Strafe left (+Y)
  strafe_right: d      # Strafe right (-Y)
  rotate_left: q       # Rotate counter-clockwise (+Z)
  rotate_right: e      # Rotate clockwise (-Z)
  
  # Future: Safety/Mode keys (not yet implemented)
  # enable_motion: shift  # Hold to enable movement (dead-man switch)
  # turbo_mode: ctrl      # Hold for 2x speed
  # slow_mode: alt        # Hold for 0.5x speed

# Safety Features (future implementation)
safety:
  require_enable_key: false    # Require holding a key to enable motion
  enable_key: shift            # Key that must be held (if required)
  timeout_ms: 500              # Timeout for key release (future)

# Additional Settings
settings:
  # Combine keys for diagonal movement
  allow_diagonal: true
  
  # Allow simultaneous linear and angular motion
  allow_angular_with_linear: true

# Notes:
# - Multiple keys can be pressed simultaneously for diagonal movement
# - Keyboard control does NOT work over SSH (requires physical keyboard)
# - Use Xbox or joystick mode for remote operation
