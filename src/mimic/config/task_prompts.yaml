# Task Prompts for VLA Model Training
# Optimized for models like Pi0, Groot, OpenVLA, etc.
# 
# Format: Clear, action-oriented instructions focusing on:
#   1. Initial conditions/context
#   2. Navigation/movement actions
#   3. Manipulation actions
#   4. Goal/target state
#
# Guidelines for VLA prompts:
#   - Use present tense, imperative form
#   - Be specific about spatial relationships
#   - Include object colors/shapes when relevant
#   - Mention multi-step sequences explicitly
#   - Keep it concise but complete (1-3 sentences)

  # Mobile Bimanual Tasks
  mobile_bimanual_blue_block_handover:
    short: "Navigate to table, pick blue block, transfer between hands, place in target area"
    full: "Navigate to table front by strafing left while turning clockwise. Pick up the blue block with the arm closest to it. Transfer the block mid-air to the opposite arm. Place the block in the designated target area using the receiving arm."
    variants:
      simple: "Move to table front. Pick blue block with nearest arm. Hand off to other arm. Place in target zone."
      detailed: "Starting from the side of the table, navigate to the front position by executing a coordinated strafe-left and clockwise-turn maneuver. Upon reaching the front, identify the blue block's position and select the appropriate arm for initial grasp. Execute a secure pick using that arm, then perform a mid-air hand-off transfer to the opposite arm. Finally, place the block precisely in the marked target area using the receiving arm."
  
  mobile_bimanual_block_sorting:
    short: "Sort colored blocks from table to bins using both arms"
    full: "Navigate around the table while picking up colored blocks with the nearest arm. Transfer blocks between arms as needed for efficient sorting. Place each block into its matching colored bin."
  
  mobile_bimanual_dual_pick_place:
    short: "Pick two objects simultaneously and place in target positions"
    full: "Position in front of the table. Simultaneously grasp two objects using both arms. Navigate to target area while maintaining grasps. Place both objects in their designated positions."

  # Navigation Tasks
  navigate_to_table_front:
    short: "Move from table side to front position"
    full: "From starting position at table side, strafe left while rotating clockwise to reach the centered front position facing the table."
  
  navigate_around_obstacle:
    short: "Navigate around obstacle to reach target position"
    full: "Identify obstacle location. Plan path around obstacle using appropriate combination of forward, strafe, and rotation movements. Reach target position on opposite side."

  # Bimanual Manipulation Tasks
  bimanual_handover:
    short: "Transfer object from one arm to the other"
    full: "Grasp object with first arm. Move second arm into receiving position. Execute controlled hand-off transfer. Release from first arm while maintaining grasp with second arm."
  
  bimanual_lift_large_object:
    short: "Use both arms to lift large object"
    full: "Position both arms symmetrically on opposite sides of the large object. Simultaneously grasp and lift using coordinated upward motion. Maintain balanced grip throughout movement."

  # Single Arm Tasks (for reference)
  pick_and_place:
    short: "Pick object and place in target location"
    full: "Approach and grasp the object securely. Lift to safe height. Navigate to target location. Lower and release object precisely in designated area."
  
  push_to_target:
    short: "Push object to target location"
    full: "Approach object from behind. Make contact with object. Apply forward force while guiding object toward target position. Stop when object reaches target zone."

# Usage Examples:
# 
# Basic recording with default task:
#   mimic-record --task-name blue_block_handover --version 1
#
# Custom task description:
#   mimic-record --task-name custom_task --version 1 \
#     --task-desc "Pick red cube, place on shelf"
#
# Training with specific prompt variant:
#   Use task_prompts['mobile_bimanual_blue_block_handover']['detailed']
